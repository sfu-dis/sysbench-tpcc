# results

The default results generated by sysbench are stored on
{1,10,50,100}_connections/{NOQ2,Q2R,Q2F,Q2L}.out. Each connection subdirectory 
has a threads directory, these dirs store the results of scheduling times.

Each thread stores its statistics on a own file, so this directory has some
scripts to gather these results and make tables out of it.

* resume.sh
	./resume.sh
	This script access each directory containing thread files as described above 
and gather all the results on single files. It also separates data of each 
transaction type for the next scripts.

* gatherMeans.sh
	./gatherMeans.sh
	Reads the resume files created with the resume.sh scripts, it also uses the
summ.py script to summ all the values found and calculate the means. The result 
are saved on files under the same directory.

* mktable.sh
	./mktable.sh
	Reads the mean files created by gatherMeans.sh and creates tables on the
current directory.

It is essencial to run these scripts on this order, it would be possible to 
gather these scripts on one file, and also to make options so it would operate 
on different directory trees.
